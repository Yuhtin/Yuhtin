### 👨‍💻 About Me
- **Early Start:** Began coding at 11 by building Minecraft mods — which evolved into open-source projects at [NextPlugins](https://github.com/nextplugins).  
- **Professional Journey:** Worked at [Jungle](https://itsjungle.xyz), contributing to Web2 & Web3 systems, and now study Computer Science at [Inteli](https://inteli.edu.br) with a scholarship from the [Telles Foundation](https://tellesfoundation.uk/pt/home/).  
- **Purpose:** I believe technology is a tool to expand access to education. My long-term goal is to build systems that democratize learning for underprivileged communities.
